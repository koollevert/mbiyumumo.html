        Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the US needs to do something about the debt ceiling by October 18,
        or else risk defaulting on its loans shortly after.
        Senate Republicans blocked a Democrat-proposed bill&nbsp;to raise the debt ceiling on Monday,
        which will likely force the Dems to tack on the debt ceiling measure to their budget bill.

 But high-growth tech stocks can take a hit when yields spike.
 These companies are expensive relative to their current earnings,
 
 
 and are priced based on their growth prospects five or 10 years down the road (see: Tesla’s mammoth $770 billion market cap).


 Rising yields, and the higher returns they offer investors,
 
 
 can make bonds more attractive relative to riskier stocks.
